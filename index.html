        <h1>How To Play</h1>
        <p>Captain Smith finds a treasure chest in an island and is having a hard time unlocking it. He sees another
            pirate (player) and asks the pirate to help him unlock the chest on the condition that he gets half of what
            is inside.</p>
        <p>To play the game, player clicks on the "Play" button. Game introduction is displayed. The game proper starts
            upon clicking the “Start” button. To unlock the chest, player needs to guess the 3-digit combination by
            scrolling through the numbers on the lock and clicking on the “Unlock” button. No two numbers are the same.</p>
        <p>If the combination is right, treasure chest is opened and player wins. However, if the combination is wrong,
            player will be notified and gets to guess the combination again. Player is informed if there is any matching
            number in the combination entered. The player is being timed as to how long he/she can unlock the chest. There is also a "Hint" button to help the player. Player only loses when he/she gives up and clicks on the “Give up” button.</p>
        <p>When the “Give up” button is clicked, the correct combination will be displayed and the player gets to choose
            to play again (resets the game) or close the game.</p>

        <h1>About The Game</h1>
        <h3>Game Concept</h3>
        <p>Unlock The Treasure Chest is a pirate-themed guessing game where the player guesses the 3-digit lock
            combination of the treasure chest to find out what is inside the chest. The player is being timed as to how
            long he/she can open the chest. The 3-digit lock combination is randomly picked by the computer so it
            changes every game. A "Hint" button is also available to help the player.</p>
        <h3>Technology</h3>
        <p>Responsive web design and being mobile-first were considered primarily during the conceptualization of this
            application. The basic layout and structure were created using HTML while custom-styling and animation were done using CSS. Core JavaScript was used to create the game’s features and functionality.</p>
        <h3>Disclaimer and Credits</h3>
        <p>Images such as the background, pirate and treasure chest are from the internet. The rest of the graphics were
            done by the developer. Audio clips are royalty-free and public domain downloaded from the internet. This
            application is for portfolio / demo purposes only and not intended for commercial use.</p>
